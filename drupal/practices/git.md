Drupal projects should be maintained using version control, such as Git.

# Git Branches

There should be matching git branches in relation to the environments defined on the hosting platform. For example:

- `develop` - Active development branch (pull request merge target)
- `main` - Stable branch of the site, should be clean and ready for hot fixes as needed
- `1.2.3` - Production releases should use git tags rather than a branch. Tags should be created directly from the latest commit on main after a new release merge.

In addition, there are a number of branching strategies that can be used by developers. [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) are two such branching strategies.

For example, if using Git Flow, a developer would checkout the `develop` branch, pull the most recent changes, and then checkout a new branch off of that such as `feature/OLAS-123--foobar`. They would then make their changes, commit them, and create a pull request against the `develop` branch.

Towards the end of the development sprint, the lead developer could then checkout a branch such as `release/1.2.3`, corresponding to the expected git tag that will be created for the new version. This branch would then have a new pull request created with `main` as the merge target. After it's merged, a new `1.2.3` git tag would be created, and the production environment would be updated to use the new tag.

# Drupal 8 .gitignore

Rather than committing the entire codebase to the git repository, you'll want to use the project's .gitignore file to ignore anything that's handled via composer (in addition to files that you normally wouldn't commit, such as settings.php). By not committing those files, you'll save a lot of time on conflicts caused by merging in updates from Drupal core and contributed modules, and the conflicts that instead occur in composer.lock are often easier to resolve.

For an example .gitignore structure, assuming that composer.json lives in the root of the repo and the project is stored in a folder named `web`:

```markdown
# Ignore directories generated by Composer
/bin/
/console/language/
/drush/Commands/
/drush/contrib/
/vendor/
/docroot/core/
/docroot/modules/contrib/
/docroot/themes/contrib/
/docroot/profiles/contrib/
/docroot/libraries/

# Ignore databases.
*.sql
*.sql.gz

# Ignore sensitive information
/docroot/sites/*/settings.local.php
/docroot/sites/*/settings.ddev.php

# Ignore services configuration
/docroot/sites/*/services.yml

# Ignore SimpleTest multi-site environment.
/docroot/sites/simpletest

# Ignore files generated by PhpStorm
/.idea/

# Ignore .env files as they are personal
/.env

# Ignore build directories
build

.editorconfig
.gitattributes

# Ignore local drush configuration.
/drush/drush.yml

# Ignore paths that contain user-generated content.
/docroot/files
/docroot/sites/*/files
/docroot/sites/*/private
```

# Commit Messages

When making commits, you'll want to follow a clear system for keeping commit messages organized and easy to ready, both in their one line summary and their detailed message. Chris Beams has a great article on the [seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) that's summarized as:

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

For example:

```markdown
OLAS-123: Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
change? Here's the place to explain them.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 - Bullet points are okay, too

 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
   vary here

If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
like this:
