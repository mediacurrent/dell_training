# Drupal practices

This section focuses on practices for building Drupal websites that are considered standard and recommended by the Drupal community. Adhering to these practices will ensure your code is manageable in the long term. These practices make it easier when upgrading contrib and custom code.

In addition to the detailed practices in this book, here are other high-level best practices that would help you and your team during development:

1. Always use the same environment:  This will result in consistency among developers and issues are easier to track and resolve.
2. Backup, backup, backup.
3. Never hack core:  This is considered the golden rule which should never be broken.
4. Use test sites.
5. Use Configuration Management and ensure it is always 100% accurate across your site.
6. Avoid excessive number of modules.  This could result in poor performance of your website, but it could also make it harder to maintain or upgrade your website.  This also includes custom modules.
7. Follow coding standards.
