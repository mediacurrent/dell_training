# Code Editors

When developing Drupal 8 projects, a well-configured code editor can make a significant impact on developers' ability to write code efficiently and debug it. Two popular options in the community are PhpStorm and Visual Studio Code.

## PhpStorm

[PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) is a powerful IDE for PHP development. For more information on configuring it, read through the [documentation at Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/development-tools/configuring-phpstorm).

PhpStorm includes built-in support for Drupal, including hooks, services, XDebug, and code sniffing.

## Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) \(VS Code\) is a free and lightweight code editor developed by Microsoft that has a number of powerful extensions to enhance the Drupal development experience. For more information on configuring VS Code for Drupal, read through the [documentation at Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/development-tools/configuring-visual-studio-code).

VS Code extensions can be installed to add PHP Intellisense, Drupal 8 snippets, Twig language support, and phpcs code sniffing.
