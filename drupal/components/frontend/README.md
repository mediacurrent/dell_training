# Building Components

Contrary to the traditional way we have been building websites for years, a component-based approach makes possible to start building your project on the Front-End. In this section we will first build a Card component which will be the base for displaying blog posts in teaser view mode. Following the Card, we will proceed on building a collection of Cards component called **From our blog**, which will represent a list of blog posts that use a number of individual Card components. Below are both of the components we will be building.

## Keeping Drupal in mind

While building the above components in Pattern Lab, It is important to think in Drupal terms so we can build components that more easily reflect the way Drupal would handle the components. This makes it possible to more efficiently integrate the front-end components with Drupal.
