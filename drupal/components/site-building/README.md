# Site building

Before components built in the Front-End can be integrated with Drupal, we need to build the Drupal infrastructure needed for the integration.  This part is typically done at the bgining of a project if you are working on a traditional development workflow, but in a component-based development approach, this step is typically done in parallel or after building the components in the front-end.

This section will cover how to build all the pieces needed by our components.  These pieces include Content types, Views, View Modes, and other Site-building tasks.
