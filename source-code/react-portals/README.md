# React - Progressive Decouple Custom Theme Demo

- `npm install`
- `npm run build` - creates bundle.js file
- `npm run start` - starts local server and reloads when code is updated.
- `dist/index.html` - Initial markup when server is running.
- `src/index.tsx` - Entry file. Currently 4 'apps' are loaded and mount to the DOM supplied in `dist/index.html`. Remove DOM to test different configurations.

You can add this as a custom theme to a Drupal project by including it `themes/custom/olas`.
