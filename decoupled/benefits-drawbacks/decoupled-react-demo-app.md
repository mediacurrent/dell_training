# Decoupled React Demo App

We built a small react app to demo how to integrate it with Drupal for a progressive decouple example.

The app consists of a Google spreadsheet as its data source, a sandbox web server to host the react app, and finally, a drupal instance running on Pantheon.

The premese of the app was to build a component-based app that can be individually mount on Drupal using Drupal blocks with specific IDS.  The react app feeds of the Google Spreasheet, and when mounted in Drupal the app;s data can be updated in Drupal.

Below are the resources where you can grab the codebase for this app.
